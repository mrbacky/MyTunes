Here the delete song could be improved, so duplicate songs on playlist don't get removed. We can store index of song in listView as a order value in DB. 

TO DO:
			1.) FLAW - deleteSongFromPlaylist
2.) SKIP BUTTON
			3.) YES - remove useless green labels
			4.) YES - delete useless scenes: editPlaylist, editSong
5.) remove not used controls.
6.) redesign deletePlaylist Popup, deleteSong Popup
			7.) YES - resize stage
			8.) YES - change search button to label
			9.) YES - set Name of selected playlist in MIDDLE LABEL
9.1) Play Song from Library
			10.) YES - DELETE PLAYLIST, DELETE SONG - set LABEL of selected item

			FIXED!! BUG: Previous Genre in edit Song is not showing.

BUG: ( song1 is playing. now u play song2 ... song1 will continue for a few secs)
